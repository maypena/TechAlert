## Introduction

Little Brothers Friends of the Elderly, a non-profit organization, is committed to relieving isolation  and loneliness in the elderly population by providing them with programs that combat loneliness and promote independent living. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, these efforts to reduce loneliness become much more difficult as physical distancing is required for the safety and wellbeing of the elderly. Fortunately, we now have access to apps that make staying connected easier through the use of technology. However, many elderly people face a lot of trouble in operating their devices and using such-often complicated- apps. 

Tech Alert, an Android app, aims to ease this confusion by connecting the people in need of technological help to highly-trained, empathetic, and tech-savvy volunteers. TechAlert will easily be available to install on GooglePlay. Once installed, the app will function with two clicks. The first click, the app icon, will launch the app and the second click, a ‘start’ button, will start the video chat. Once the ‘start’ button is pressed, TechAlert will match the user with an available TechAlert volunteer and the video chat will begin. The volunteer will be able to ask for permission to gain access to the users screen, thus facilitating the channel of communication. 

## Installation

Download the most recent version of Android studio and appropriate SDK packages (you will be prompted during/after the download process): https://developer.android.com/studio
 Download the TechAlert application package, unzip it, and open it on Android Studio. 
In the future, we aim to have it available on GooglePlay and AppleStore (iOS version).

## Usage

Connect an Android device (external or configured virtual emulator) to Android studio.
Build and run the app through the android device.
Enable camera and microphone permissions through the settings for the TechAlert app on the phone.
Click “Start” to begin a call, or “Disconnect” to end the call.
